A PyTorch implementation of the NeurIPS 2017 paper: [Generating Steganographic Images via Adversarial Training](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/fe2d010308a6b3799a3d9c728ee74244-Abstract.html).

## Usage

PyTorch related dependencies are defined in `environment.yml`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n advsteg
```

Then activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate advsteg
```

*[Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) (drop-in replacement for conda) is also supported and is what I used for training.*

Dev-dependencies are defined and installed with Poetry:

```bash
# Inside the conda-created environment
poetry install
```

[Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) is used for logging and visualization. You can either create an account and login with `wandb login` or add the environment variable `WANDB_MODE=disabled` to disable logging.
